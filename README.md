# battlebots
java project that used linear regression model for battlebots to know when to attack.
I wrote this back in 1999 while attending a java II class at UCSD.

The professor wanted us to build a simple game in which on the screen little square robots are in an arena and they randomly attack each other.

I took this a step further and instead of having robots randomly attack each other - I had the robots first collect attributes from opposing robots and then use a linear regression model to determine whether they should attack or not.

This was super cool but I lost the final assignment with the model.  I'd like to recreate this some day.
